notes: |
  These are our default input text field styles. Here are some basic rules when writing markup for form inputs:

    1. Inputs should always be inside of a `<form>` element.
    1. All inputs should have a corresponding label element with matching `for` and `id` attributes for accessibility and proper functionality
    1. Each coupled `label` and `input` elements should be surrounded by the `.field` class

  The error colored background and border will be displayed in browsers that support the `:invalid` pseudo class, but we'll be using a JS validator on all forms to ensure progressive enhancement and browsers will also be receiving the `.is-error` class on the invalid input's surround `.field` block.  The invalid states below are seen when a user inputs an incorrect value for the specified input type.

<form action="" class="form">
  {{> input-text id="username" label="Username" }}
</form>
