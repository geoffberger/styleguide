  Various helpers for single element quick fixes. Helper classes should be able to used anywhere at anytime with no dependencies or over specific styling e.g., `text-align: center;` with a helper class of `.u-text-center` All helper classes are prefixed with the 'u-' namespace('U' for utility) for readability purposes for developers.
